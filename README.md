Bugs and Fixes:

1) On the edit profile section when you add a prefix it should automatically appear in the prefix section next time you go on the page, this was not happening. I discovered a bug in the code in the required value attribute. It turned out value was spelt wrong so I fixed it and this fixed the bug.
